# I built my own text editor 'Maho'  !

Maho is a simple text editor, simpler than nano :P for minimalistic people.

Using "termios" library as my main inspiration, i tried to built maho.

## Maho's features:

* Text viewer

* Text editor

* Save after editing

* Save as

* Search in file

* Recursive search


## TODO:

- [ ] Text color

- [ ] Synthaxe highlighting detection

- [ ] Line numbers

- [ ] Copy and paste

- [ ] Use "ncurses" library
